A T L A S Custom Weapons & Equipment

Port of A T L A S's old weapons, equipment, and clothing to SPT's latest version.


All credit goes to A T L A S for all the original assets and Nomad_420 for his port.


WARNING - Before updating SPT versions, if you want to carry over your profile and won't have this mod in the next version, make sure you follow the uninstall directions at the bottom *before* updating!


Installation:

Download the .zip file, extract all, and add the folder ATLAS-GEAR to your user/mods/ folder in SPT. Make sure it is just the folder with all of the contents, not a folder with another ATLAS-GEAR folder inside of it, else the mod will probably throw an error!

The directory should look like this:

/user/mods/ATLAS-GEAR/

and not this:

/user/mods/ATLAS-GEAR_X.X.X/ATLAS-GEAR/


Config Options:

    1. lvl1Traders  - Change this from false to true to change all of the items sold by traders to be available at level 1 loyalty level.

Known Issues:

    1. The SR-25 FDE uses default SR-25 audio instead of the RSASS audio like the old ATLAS mods.
    2. The barrels and muzzle devices do not glow red-hot like they should because that feature did not exist when A T L A S first made his mods. I believe I can eventually change them to working, but there is no ETA at this time.


Uninstalling:

If for whatever reason you need to remove this mod, make sure you remove any new items that this mod adds from your inventory before you delete the mod folder, including changing back to normal clothes and deleting any presets that have new items!


Let me know if there are any other issues with it!
